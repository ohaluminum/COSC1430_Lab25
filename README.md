# COSC1430_Lab25

    Create a function Template called swapTemplate so that it takes two parameters of the same type. swapTemplate will exchange the values of these two parameters.

    Create another function template called largest that takes three parameters of the same type, and returns the largest value amongst the three.

    Class Character is provided and partially implemented. To apply the above two function templates to the Character objects, you will need to implement overloading operator== and operator >. The return type of both operators is bool.

        -Operator ==: two characters are equal if their type and level are the same.

        -Operator >: character with higher level is larger. If they have the same level, compare using their type. (for example: at the same level, type "Wizard" is larger than "Human" alphabetically)
